# Rafael M. Mateo Lee - Personal CV website

The website contains my CV, a list of my programming experience. The website is written in HTML with CSS / CSS styling, and some JavaScript is used to generate a pop-up when a button is activated (Programming page).

## Website Files:

The website is composed of 2 .html pages (Index (i.e. a CV, and Programming). .html files are located in the top level of the directory; JavaScript files are stored in the /scripts directory; images, icons, and PDFs in /images; and CSS / SCSS files in /styles.
